# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Overview

This project operates under a Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL) governance model. The BDFL, Leik Andre Asbjørnsen Butenschøn, is the final authority on all matters related to the project, including but not limited to design decisions, contributions, and community conduct. This model ensures that the project maintains a consistent vision and direction.

## Basic Principles

1. **Respect and Professionalism**: All contributors are expected to treat each other with respect and professionalism. Disagreements are inevitable, but they should be handled maturely and constructively.

2. **Collaboration**: Contributions are welcome from anyone who is interested in improving the project. Constructive collaboration and the sharing of ideas are encouraged, with the understanding that the BDFL has the final say in all decisions.

3. **Decision-Making**: While input from contributors is valued and considered, the BDFL has ultimate authority over all decisions. This includes technical choices, feature implementations, and resolving disputes. The BDFL's decisions are final and not subject to debate.

4. **Contribution Guidelines**: Contributors should adhere to the project's contribution guidelines when submitting changes. Contributions that do not align with the project's goals or that introduce unnecessary complexity may be rejected by the BDFL.

5. **Code and Conduct**: The focus is on producing high-quality code that serves the project’s goals. Contributors are expected to keep discussions and contributions related to the project itself, avoiding unrelated issues.

## Conflict Resolution

In the event of a conflict between contributors, the BDFL will act as the mediator. The BDFL’s decision in resolving conflicts is final. Contributors are encouraged to resolve minor disputes among themselves before escalating to the BDFL.

## Community Conduct

The project aims to foster a professional and productive environment. Contributors are expected to:

- Keep discussions relevant to the project and its goals.
- Provide constructive feedback and be open to receiving the same.
- Refrain from personal attacks, inflammatory language, or any behavior that disrupts the project’s work.

## Enforcement

Failure to adhere to this Code of Conduct may result in actions such as:

- Removal of contributions from the project.
- Banning from future contributions.
- Revocation of any associated roles or privileges within the project.

The BDFL has full discretion to enforce these rules and make decisions in the best interest of the project.
