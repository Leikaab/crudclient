# Create base client model for restful libraries

## Run project locally via dev-containers

A **development container** is a running [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites. 

[![Open in Remote - Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Remote%20-%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/Leikaab/crudclient)

If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can click the badge above to automatically install the Remote - Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.

If this is your first time using a development container, please ensure your system meets the prerequisites (i.e. have Docker installed) in the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

## Test out project

Once you have this project opened, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally.

Note that ha bounch of key extentions are allready installed + there is local project settings set up in the background, even though there is no settings.json file. These settings are made to match with developmental team standards.

> **Note:** This container runs as a non-root user with sudo access by default.
